Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibit changes in how they learn from rewards and losses in non-social contexts. However, it remains unclear whether their capacity to learn from social interactions is similarly affected.

    ### Within-Subjects Design:
    - **Levels of Prior Reputation:** No Information, High Reputation, Low Reputation
    - **Levels of Actual Trustworthiness:** High Trustworthiness, Low Trustworthiness, Coaxing (betrayal), Tit for Tat (reciprocity)
    - **Gain-Loss Frame:** Gain, Loss

    ### Between-Subjects Variables:
    - **Personality Traits**
    - **Cognitive Abilities**

    ### Dependent Variables:
    - **Investment Proportion per Round**
    - **Cumulative Investment Proportion**
    - **Slope of Cumulative Proportion Over Time**
    - **Initial Investment Proportion** (Decreased cooperation tendency can be reflected in the drop of investment proportion)

    We modified the rTG (Fouragnan, 2013) by altering the disclosure of partners' reputations and the likelihood of reciprocity, with participants consistently playing the role of investors.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
