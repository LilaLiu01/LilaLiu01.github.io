Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibit changes in how they learn from rewards and losses in non-social contexts. However, it remains unclear whether their capacity to learn from social interactions is similarly affected.

    Within-Subjects Design:
    - Levels of Prior Reputation:** No Information, High Reputation, Low Reputation
    - Levels of Actual Trustworthiness:** High Trustworthiness, Low Trustworthiness, Coaxing (betrayal), Tit for Tat (reciprocity)
    - Gain-Loss Frame:** Gain, Loss

    Between-Subjects Variables:
    - Personality Traits**
    - Cognitive Abilities**

    Dependent Variables:
    - Investment Proportion per Round**
    - Cumulative Investment Proportion**
    - Slope of Cumulative Proportion Over Time**
    - Initial Investment Proportion** (Decreased cooperation tendency can be reflected in the drop of investment proportion)

The AIC, BIC, and the parsimony principle consistently favored the **GL model** across all experimental conditions for each participant group. Model recovery indicated that simulations based on the **GL model** successfully captured the key aspects of the original investment behavior.
