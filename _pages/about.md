Welcome! Iâ€™m Lila. Thank you for taking a moment to visit my personal page! This is designed for communicating with fellow scientists and curious minds alike. Currently, I am a research assistant at Perception & Motion Lab at UC Berkeley with Prof. [David Whitney](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/david-whitney) and Dr. [Veith Weilnhammer](https://veithweilnhammer.github.io/) to investigate serial dependence.

In my academic pursuits, I have developed interest in visual perception, attention, computational modeling of cognition and behavior, perceptual engineering in XR space. 

A key aspect of my educational journey has been my passion for teaching and exploring pedagogical theories. I strongly advocate for the Concrete-Representational-Abstract approach and Scaffolding Theory.

During my gap year, I have also been actively engaging with industry mentoring like AWS for contrastive learning in fMRI analysis, and collaborating with XR Bootcamp to develop more academia-friendly implementations for vision-related research in virtual environments.

Also, I love playing Go, playing piano and guitar, and all kinds of outdoor adventures. Durian and lobster are the ultimate stars of my culinary universe!
