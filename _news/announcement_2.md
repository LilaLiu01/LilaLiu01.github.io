<span style="font-size: 0.95em;">I will be presenting a poster on how visual mode switching benefited observers maintain perceptual accuracy while experience geometric distortions induced by lenses at VSS this year. Come stop by on Tuesday (5/20) morning (8:30-12:30) in the Banyan Breezeway!</span>

#### Importance

<ul>
    <li>Scientific impact: this work will provide the first laboratory evidence for mode switching in shape perception.</li>
    <li>Clinical relevance: assist protocols that aid in the “non-adaptation” to new optical prescriptions. Additionally, this work is applicable to perceptual training programs for unique visual environments, such as those encountered by radiologists and pathologists searching for abnormalities in clinical images. </li>
</ul>
